Underprepared Supply Chains: How are our Food Retailers

              <p >Now classed

                during the COVID19 worldwide
                pandemic
                response, they are
                finally receiving the
                praise they deserve.
                That is, if you
                exclude reports of
                them being
                coughed at or
                verbally abused
                during shifts for
                enforcing protective
                measures. Supermarket employees are persevering through a crisis without
                precedent in their lifetimes. May they receive enough claps to compensate for their
                minimum wage salary, incredibly stressful work environments and general threat to
                life.

                Meanwhile, with the closure of restaurants, cafes and local markets, supermarket
                sales have jumped by a fifth, as shoppers rushed to buy an extra £1.9bn of groceries
                and personal goods. As a result, supermarket chains are scrambling to keep shelves
                stocked whilst training ‘the youth of today’ under ever-changing government
                guidelines, and enforcing social distancing in their stores without the option of using
                tasers and speed guns. Tesco, for instance, reported that in the 10 days prior to 31st
                March they had 35,000 new members of staff join the company. With supermarkets
                busier now than even at the Christmas period, a seasonal spike in footfall so extreme
                even canned sardines describe it as “a bit stuffy”, millions have sought work at our
                nation’s biggest food retailers to help them cope despite the inherent risks.   
             </p>

              <span class="c">
                What issues are stores facing?
              </span>

              <p>
                Hiring an army of good-intentioned workers with little or no experience comes with
obstacles. Many new employees have been tossed into the deep end without so
much as a pool noodle to cling to, as they try to navigate an unfamiliar work
environment sporting newly imposed safety measures. Add into the mix every irate
Karen, Sharon and Steve muttering their complaints whilst panic buying all the toilet
paper in existence, and you have a recipe for operational jeopardy. This trolley-full of
issues has arisen for supermarket chains in a matter of weeks, creating the very real
paradox of empty shelves and a mountain of waste.

              </p>
              <p> Yet, despite your embarrassing distant relatives hoarding essential items as
                desperately as awkward jokes to drop at family gatherings, food waste has risen
                sharply and alarmingly. “Why is this?” you might ask. Well, it boils down to a supply
                chain that relies on stability and predictability being rocked by both the shutdown of
                the hospitality sector as well as panic buying. If stores can predict demand, they can
                stock appropriately and minimise food waste, but thanks to the uncertainty of
                coronavirus, experience curves have exited stage left leading to an alarming loss of
                supply. The depressing irony is that despite plenty of unspoiled food being thrown
                away due to closure of restaurants, cafes and hospitality events, many supermarket
                shelves have been collecting dust and weeping for the swift return of pasta, flour and
                tinned tomatoes. However, empty shelves don’t necessarily denote a shortage of
                food and supplies so much as they lay bare an ill-prepared supply chain trying to
                keep up with increased demand. If you’re wondering why our biggest supermarkets
                have been so wholly blindsided despite months of warnings, let me introduce you to
                “Just In Time” inventory.</p>
              <span class="c">
                What is Just In Time inventory? 
              </span>

              <p>
                Up until the 1980’s, supermarkets held the majority of their stock in the back rooms
of stores, but during a period of economic downturn in 1977, those radical
trailblazers at Tesco changed the game, or rather, invented a whole new game called
‘winning’. They found that cash-strapped customers were shopping far less than
usual due to financial uncertainty, and thus began ‘Operation Checkout’, the
suburban Bond film nobody ever watched. Tesco found a way to cut prices by
swapping to a “just in time” or “JIT” inventory model, now seen widely across stores
today, where instead of storing bulk deliveries of supplies in the back, they’d order in
stock daily based on each individual store’s demand and suppliers subsequently
send these goods to the supermarket’s distribution centre. To cut storage costs,
retailers have ditched housing the bulk of stock themselves, meaning what you see
on the shelves is often the majority of what the supermarket currently has on site.
In normal circumstances, the JIT supply chain model is very efficient and saves both
the retailer and their consumers money. But the pandemic deconstructed this
‘superior’ supply chain model’s efficiency as artfully as a cheesecake on Masterchef
when demand surged under lockdown. Even worse, research findings have
suggested only a few extra items per household’s weekly shop was enough to do the
damage. 
              </p>
              <p>  Let me paint you a picture: if a crazed mugger unexpectedly accosts you in an alley,
                would you rely on a superhero called Just-In-Time Man, famed for his last-minute
                appearances, to come to your rescue? What if he runs into traffic? What if there’s a
                family emergency he’s got to sort out first? He’s not left himself any time to ring up
                Superman to cover his shift and you’ve probably already lost your wallet during his
                moral dilemma. In reality the vicious cycle goes like this: distribution centres are
                running low on stock due to increased demand, but they can’t get more stock into
                these centres because they can’t deliver to the supermarkets fast enough,
                meanwhile supermarkets don’t even have the backroom space to store it all. This
                cost-cutting model was never built to deal with a worldwide pandemic and it’s been
                shockingly apparent. 
                </p>
<span class="c">

    What are supermarkets doing to adapt and cope with issues presented by
    coronavirus?
</span>
<p>
    For their latest mission, should they choose to accept it, supermarkets must address
    these challenges in what I have dubbed ‘Operation Coronavirus’. It’s been crucial for
    essential retailers like supermarkets to make swift changes to operations to meet the
    increased demand whilst keeping employees safe. But what actions have they taken
    to achieve this? To dissuade shoppers from jumping on the panic-buying
    bandwagon, the major supermarket chains have all issued similar statements to
    customers that there is plenty of food and supplies for the many, if the few would
    stop selfishly bulk buying it.
    
</p>
<img class="super-img2" src="img/figure2.png" alt="">
<p> Some supermarkets have responded by slimming down product ranges to enable
    them to focus on essentials. This means you might not be able to find those cute little pasta bows you love so much on the shelves, but a health worker hitting the
    supermarket after a long shift might be able to finally buy a single bag of drably
    shaped spaghetti for next week’s meals. It has also proved important to focus
    employees time on essential restocking, manning entrances and swiftly serving
    customers on the tills by closing meat, fish, deli and salad bars, which will also
    reduce waste. Some retailers have even repurposed employees from closed
    departments to work in crucial areas desperate for manpower, like John Lewis, who
    deployed staff to their Waitrose supermarkets. Meanwhile, the government has
    attempted to ease the strain on food retailers by treating logistics workers the same
    way as the emergency services including NHS staff. </p>
    <p> Despite the constant stream of hurdles that supermarket supply chains have faced,
        their priority is to keep essential items flowing. With more and more workers selfisolating or becoming ill, supermarkets have compensated by launching mass
        recruitment campaigns, collaborating with the Freight Transport Association to
        ensure that trucks still get services as and when required, and imposing restrictions
        on the quantity of essential items you can purchase in a single shop to manage
        demand.</p>
<span class="c">
    Conclusion
</span>
<p>
    Ultimately, despite unprecedented and unpredictable demand exposing the
    weakness of JIT inventory, the system will likely be able to cope so long as staffing
    levels can be maintained and imports are not disrupted for a long period of time. But
    I think the moral centre of the crisis response has been the dedication and bravery of
    essential workers. I’ll use the tannoy to announce this next part, “Ladies and
    gentlemen, humble gratitude, eternal thanks and an increase in wages for essential
    food distribution staff to aisle 5”. Just recently, across the pond, the US’s 8th largest
    retailer, Target, raised their minimum wage to $15 permanently having initially raised
    it to that level as ‘hazard pay’.
     
</p>
<p> There is also a real opportunity here, exposed to us by the impact of coronavirus, for
    reassessment in retail manufacturing models and operations. Keeping my ear to the
    ground, I’ve picked up on promising rumbles in the technology and supply chain
    sectors of adapting software to keep existing staff safe, increase the efficiency and
    productivity of new staff as fast as possible and to make sure customers have access
    to essential items. As one example, an app downloadable to any smartphone that
    displays precisely where items are on the shelves could be time and cost effective,
    particularly for new hires. If a young employee unfamiliar with their new work
    environment needed to restock the coffee shelf, an app like this could potentially
    allow them to search for this item, even down to the brand, for the quick restocking
    required in a post-coronavirus world. Ideas like these could be part of an important
    rethink of supermarket supply chain models. As the Bond villain from Operation
    Checkout might utter in a classic monologue that reveals the entirety of his devious
    plans, just in time logistics may just be out of time.</p>
